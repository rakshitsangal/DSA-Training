'''
An array is good, if it satisfies the following criteria:

If array is of size N, then it should contain all elements from 1 to N.

As a direct consequence of the above statement, the array does not contain duplicate elements.

The array should not be sorted in ascending order.

Given N and elements of the array, your task is to check if it is Good or Not.

Input Format 

The first line contains N representing array size. The next line contains N space separated integers representing the elements of array.

Constraints

2<=N<=100 1<=A<=100 where A represents an array element.

Output Format

The output contains a single line. If the array satisfies all the above conditions print "Good", otherwise print "Not Good"

Sample Input 0

4
1 2 3 4
Sample Output 0

Not Good
Explanation 0

The array has all the elements from 1 to 4 and without duplicates. So criteria 1 and 2 are satisfied but the array is sorted. So criteria 3 is failed. So print Not Good.
